John is a reviewer and works for a few open source projects, besides his main job as a software developer.

After dinner John starts up his computer to review some pull requests.
Whenever he is doing reviewing he is losing so much time getting to know the changes of a pull request,
because the ordering is so illogical.

He decides to give this new tool a try a few contributors are using.
When he opens the tool he logs in with github.

Then he clicks on the Polymer/Polymer project, because that is the first project he wants to review.
He opens a new pull request and first reads the description.
After that he looks at the changes this pull request has made.
This view seems a lot more logical and he decides to comment on few changes, because he does not like them.

He then leaves an overall comment on the pull request and goes on to the next one.
